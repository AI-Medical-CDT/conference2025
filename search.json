With a focus on research excellence, collaboration, and innovation, the Centre is committed to producing highly skilled professionals who can harness AI to develop secure, privacy-compliant solutions for medical diagnosis and care. By fostering industry partnerships and international collaborations, the Centre aims to position the UK as a global leader in health-related AI research and technology transfer.\nOur annual conference brings together the CDT’s students, academics, and industry partners, offering a dynamic platform to explore and discuss the latest research from the CDT. Students will share updates on their progress, while our speakers will offer new perspectives to enrich the community. We hope that the event will provide an opportunity for our diverse network of researchers and healthcare professionals to reconnect and seek further opportunities for collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Florian Markowetz\n        Professor of Computational Oncology, University of Cambridge\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Pearl Pu\n        Senior Scientist and Maître d'Enseignement, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne\n    \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        10:00-10:45\n        \n            Registration\n            Sign in at the registration desk\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        10:45-11:00\n        \n            Welcome and Introduction\n            A warm welcome and an introduction to the event from our CDT director.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        11:00-12:00\n        \n            Keynote Title by Speaker\n            Keynote Abstract\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        12:00-13:00\n        \n            Lunch and Networking\n            The heart and soul of any conference is the food and networking.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        13:00-14:30\n        \n            Spotlights\n            A collection of short presentations by CDT students showcasing their research.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        14:30-15:00\n        \n            Coffee Break\n            Time for a break from sitting down.
