Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Florian Markowetz\n        Professor of Computational Oncology, University of Cambridge\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Pearl Pu\n        Senior Scientist and Maître d'Enseignement, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne\n    \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        10:00-10:45\n        \n            Registration\n            Sign in at at the registration desk\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        10:45-11:00\n        \n            Welcome and Introduction\n            A few words of welcome from the CDT director and an introduction to the event.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        11:00-12:00\n        \n            Keynote Title by Speaker\n            Keynote Abstract\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        12:00-13:00\n        \n            Lunch and Networking\n            The heart and soul of any conference is the food and networking.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        13:00-14:30\n        \n            Spotlights\n            A collection of short presentations by CDT students showcasing their research.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        14:30-15:00\n        \n            Coffee Break\n            Time for a break from sitting down.
